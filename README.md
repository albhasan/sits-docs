Documentation for the SITS Package
================

### Overview

The SITS package (“Satellite Image Time Series Analysis for Earth
Observation Data”) provides a set of tools for analysis, visualization
and classification of satellite image time series. It includes methods
for filtering, clustering, classification, and post-processing. This
github site has documentation on SITS, including vignettes,
presentations, and papers.
